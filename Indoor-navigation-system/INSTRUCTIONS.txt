Please follow given instructions :
1.First connect arduino(atmega 2560) with two ultrasonic sensors(HC-SR04) according to instructions given in arduino code file(ino file).
2.After setting up hardware circuit run arduino code using arduino IDE(prefferebly 1.6.5).
3.Now run Java code for making conection to cloud platform (java code is responsible for posting and getting data from cloud. Whole business logic is implemented
  in Java code).
4.Next Java code for web where ajax code will run asynchronously to fetch location co-ordinates for object and then display them on web page.


NOTE : 1.Edit the code and use your own cloud platfom ip address and other links as they may not work for you. For me it is working fine because i have the 
       proper credential and authorization.
       2. I have used Eclipse indigo IDE and tomcat server 6.0 for development.
       3.I have taken arduino atmega 2560 board and HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor.
